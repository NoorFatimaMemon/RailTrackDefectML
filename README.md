# RailTrackDefectML

A deep learning-based system for detecting surface defects in railway tracks using transfer learning.

Overview: This project automates railway track inspection by classifying images into defective and non-defective categories. It focuses on four defect types: corrugation, flaking, shelling, and squats. Data was collected from Kotri Railway Station.

Models Used: DenseNet121, DenseNet169, ResNet50V2
Best performance: DenseNet169 with 95.76% accuracy

Features
  1. Transfer learning with CNNs
  2. Data augmentation for class balance
  3. High precision and recall on defect detection
